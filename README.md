## Module 1: Lab Test–1 (Problem Statements)

### Question 1: Josephus Circle Problem
N people are arranged in a circle and every K-th person is eliminated repeatedly, starting from position 1, until only one person remains. The task is to determine the position of the last surviving person for given values of N and K.

### Question 2: Maximum Product of Five Elements
Given an array of integers (size ≥ 5) containing positive, negative, and zero values, find any five distinct elements such that their product is maximum among all possible selections.

### Question 3: Queue Using Circular Linked List
Implement a queue using a circular linked list with a single pointer acting as both front and rear. The queue should support enqueue, dequeue, peek, size, and print operations using a menu-driven program.
