 ***Module 0: Introduction & C Programming Basics***

- **Description:**  
  Introductory session for the Computing Lab course and a refresher on C programming fundamentals.

- **Key Topics:**  
  C programming basics, stacks, queues, linked lists, sorting techniques (merge sort), compiling and running C programs using GCC.

- **Reference Material:**  
  - `Introductory_Slides_CS69201.pdf ` [Introductory Slides – CS69201](./Introductory_Slides_CS69201.pdf) –  introductory lecture slides used for this class.


## Module 1: Lab Test–1 (Problem Statements)

### Question 1: Josephus Circle Problem
N people are arranged in a circle and every K-th person is eliminated repeatedly, starting from position 1, until only one person remains. The task is to determine the position of the last surviving person for given values of N and K.

### Question 2: Maximum Product of Five Elements
Given an array of integers (size ≥ 5) containing positive, negative, and zero values, find any five distinct elements such that their product is maximum among all possible selections.

### Question 3: Queue Using Circular Linked List
Implement a queue using a circular linked list with a single pointer acting as both front and rear. The queue should support enqueue, dequeue, peek, size, and print operations using a menu-driven program.

## Module 4: Trees and AVL Trees

This module covers tree-based data structures with a focus on balanced binary search trees, introducing AVL trees and their role in maintaining efficient operations.

### Topics Covered
- Basic tree terminology and properties  
- Binary Search Trees (BST)  
- Tree traversals  
- AVL trees and self-balancing rotations  
- Time complexity analysis of tree operations
